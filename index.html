          <h2>Why I decided to take programming?</h2>
            <p>First would be I've always had a passion for programming,
              in many ways. I'm interested in tech, and have been for a while. 
              This only fans the flame more.Programming for me right now offers different 
              ways to delve into a whole other dimesion of tech and expound my creativity 
              and skillset.</p>

            <p>I believe in solving problems, and I love to do so, just with tech 
              side by side. I'm learning to be able to build things, and create 
              new things as well. Not to mention the fact that getting into programming 
              doesn't require a degree. In addition, in this modern time programming is 
              integrated to most of everything if not everything.</p>

              This is a story about a wandering heart and how we've become so accustomed
              to what we take as truth other than what scripture portrays.
              Cleanliness is next to Godliness they said, err and it's definitely not in
              scripture. You know...
